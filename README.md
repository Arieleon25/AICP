# AICP: Anonymous Income Comparison Program

The Anonymous Income Comparison Program (AICP) is a program designed to compare the annual salaries of two individuals without revealing their identities. By collecting relevant information about their hourly rates and weekly hours worked, the program calculates and compares their annual incomes.

# Project Description
The AICP focuses on math and comparison operators to determine the annual salaries of two individuals, referred to as Person 1 and Person 2. It then evaluates whether Person 1 makes more money than Person 2 based on the provided information.

# Instructions
Upon running the program, it will display the message "Anonymous Income Comparison Program" to the screen.

The program will then prompt the user to enter the details for Person 1:

"Person 1":

Hours worked per week (Float)

Next, the program will prompt the user to enter the details for Person 2:

"Person 2":

Hourly Rate (Float)

Hours worked per week (Float)

After collecting the necessary information, the program will display the following information to the screen:

"Annual salary of Person 1: [exact salary]"

"Annual salary of Person 2: [exact salary]"

"Does Person 1 make more money than Person 2? [true/false]"
